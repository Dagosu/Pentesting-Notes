# Cross Site Request Forgery
**Cross Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) occurs when a user visits a page on a site, that performs an action on a different site. For instance, let's say a user clicks a link to a website created by a hacker, on the website would be an html tag such as `<img src="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net">`  which would change the account email on the vulnerable website to "pwned@evil-user.net".  CSRF works because it's the victim making the request not the site, so all the site sees is a normal user making a normal request.  

## Prevention
- **Anti CSRF Tokens**
	- generated random by the web application in the beck end and sent to the website
	- it is validated on every request so other websites can't make cross origin/domain requests
- **Same Origin Policy**

## Exploits
- **xsrfprobe** tool
	- Syntax: `xsrfprobe -u <url>/<endpoint>`
