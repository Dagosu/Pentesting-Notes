# Cross Site Request Forgery
**Cross Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) occurs when a user visits a page on a site, that performs an action on a different site. For instance, let's say a user clicks a link to a website created by a hacker, on the website would be an html tag such as `<img src="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net">`  which would change the account email on the vulnerable website to "pwned@evil-user.net".  CSRF works because it's the victim making the request not the site, so all the site sees is a normal user making a normal request.  

This opens the door, to the user's account being fully compromised through the use of a password reset for example. The severity of this cannot be overstated, as it allows an attacker to potentially gain personal information about a user, such as credit card details in an extreme case.
