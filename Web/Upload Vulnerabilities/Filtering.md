# Filtering
- **Extension Validation**
File extensions are used to identify the contents of a file. Filters either blacklist extensions or they whitelist extensions.

- **File Type Filtering**
	- **MIME** validation: MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) types are used as an identifier for files. The MIME type for a file upload is attached in the header of the request:

		MIME types follow the format `<type>/<subtype>`. The MIME type for a file can be checked client-side and/or server-side.
	- **Magic Number** validation: Magic numbers are the more accurate way of determining the contents of a file. The "magic number" of a file is a string of bytes at the very beginning of the file content which identify the content. For example, a PNG file would have these bytes at the very top of the file: `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`.

- **File Length Filtering**:
File length filters are used to prevent huge files from being uploaded to the server via an upload form. 

- **File Name Filtering**:
Files uploaded to a server should be unique. Additionally, file names should be sanitised on upload to ensure that they don't contain any "bad characters", which could potentially cause problems on the file system when uploaded (e.g. null bytes or forward slashes on Linux, as well as control characters such as `;` and potentially unicode characters).

- **File Content Filtering**:
More complicated filtering systems may scan the full contents of an uploaded file to ensure that it's not spoofing its extension, MIME type and Magic Number.
