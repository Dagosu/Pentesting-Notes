#  Bypassing Client-Side Filtering
- *Turn off Javascript in browser* -- this will work provided the site doesn't require Javascript in order to provide basic functionality.
- *Intercept and modify the incoming page*
- *Intercept and modify the file upload.* Where the previous method works before the webpage is loaded, this method allows the web page to load as normal, but intercepts the file upload after it's already passed (and been accepted by the filter).
- *Send the file directly to the upload point*. Posting the data directly to the page which contains the code for handling the file upload is another effective method for completely bypassing a client side filter.
 `curl -X POST -F "submit:<value>" -F "<file-parameter>:@<path-to-file>" <site>`
