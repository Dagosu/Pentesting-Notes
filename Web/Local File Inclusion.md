# Local File Inclusion
**LFI** is a web application vulnerability that allows the attacker to include and read local files on the server. These files could contain sensitive data such as cryptographic keys, databases that contain passwords, and other private data. The main cause of this type of vulnerability is improper sanitization of the user's input.
As an example, in the PHP, the following functions cause this kind of vulnerability:
-   include
-   require
-   include_once
-   require_once


##### What is the risk of LFI?
Once you find an LFI vulnerability, it is possible to read sensitive data if you have readable permissions on files. Also, in some cases, an LFI vulnerability could be chained to perform **Remote Code Execution** on the server. If we can inject or write to a file on the system, we take advantage of LFI to get RCE.

##### Identifying and testing for LFI
