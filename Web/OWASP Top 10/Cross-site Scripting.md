# Cross-site Scripting

## XSS Explained
Cross-site scripting, also known as **XSS** is a security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It’s a type of injection which can allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts and have it execute on a victim’s machine.

A web application is vulnerable to XSS if it uses unsanitized user input. XSS is possible in Javascript, VBScript, Flash and CSS. There are three main types of cross-site scripting:

- **Stored XSS** - the most dangerous type of XSS. This is where a malicious string originates from the website’s database. This often happens when a website allows user input that is not sanitised (remove the "bad parts" of a users input) when inserted into the database.
- **Reflected XSS** - the malicious payload is part of the victims request to the website. The website includes this payload in response back to the user. To summarise, an attacker needs to trick a victim into clicking a URL to execute their malicious payload.
- **DOM-Based XSS** - DOM stands for **Document Object Model** and is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content. A web page is a document and this document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source.

## XSS Payloads
Some common payloads types used:
- **Popup's** `(<script>alert(“Hello World”)</script>)` - Creates a Hello World message popup on a user's browser.
- **Writing HTML** (`document.write`) - Override the website's HTML to add your own (essentially defacing the entire page).
- **XSS Keylogger** - You can log all keystrokes of a user, capturing their password and other sensitive information they type into the webpage.
- **Port scanning** - A mini local port scanner
