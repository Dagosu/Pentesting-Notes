# Broken Acces Control
Websites have pages that are protected from regular visitors, for example only the site's admin user should be able to access a page to manage other users. If a website visitor is able to access the protected page/pages that they are not authorised to view, the access controls are broken.

A regular visitor being able to access protected pages, can lead to the following:
-   Being able to view sensitive information
-   Accessing unauthorized functionality

OWASP have a listed a few attack scenarios demonstrating access control weaknesses:

1. **Scenario #1**: The application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:
	```
	pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter("acct"));
	ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );
	```
