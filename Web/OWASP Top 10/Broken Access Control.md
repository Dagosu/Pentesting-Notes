# Broken Acces Control
**Broken access control** allows attackers to bypass authorization which can allow them to view sensitive data or perform tasks as if they were a privileged user.

OWASP have a listed a few attack scenarios demonstrating access control weaknesses:

1. **Scenario #1**: The application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:
	```
	pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter("acct"));
	ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );
	```
2. **Scenario #2**: An attacker simply force browses to target URLs. Admin rights are required for access to the admin page.

When Broken Access Control exploits or bugs are found, it will be categorised into one of two types:
- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**: Occurs when a user can perform an action or access data of another user with the same level of permissions.
- **Vertical Privilege Escalation**: Occurs when a user can perform an action or access data of another user with a higher level of permissions.
