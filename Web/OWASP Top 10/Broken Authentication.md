# Broken Authentication

## Common flows
- **Brute force attacks**: If a web application uses usernames and passwords, an attacker is able to launch brute force attacks that allow them to guess the username and passwords using multiple authentication attempts.
- **Use of weak credentials**: web applications should set strong password policies. If applications allow users to set passwords such as ‘password1’ or common passwords, then an attacker is able to easily guess them and access user accounts.
 - **Weak Session Cookies**: Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users. If session cookies contain predictable values, an attacker can set their own session cookies and access users’ accounts.

## Prevention
- **Avoid password guessing attacks** - ensure the application enforces a strong password policy.
- **Avoid brute force attacks** - ensure that the application enforces an automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts. This would prevent an attacker from launching more brute force attacks.
- **Implement Multi Factor Authentication** - If a user has multiple methods of authentication, for example, using username and passwords and receiving a code on their mobile device, then it would be difficult for an attacker to get access to both credentials to get access to their account.

## Exploits
- **Brute force**

- **Re-register an user**
Ex: existing user: "admin"
New user: " admin"

- **JSON Web Token**
JSON Web Token(JWT) is one of the commonly used methods for authorization. This is a kind of cookie that is generated using HMAC hashing or public/private keys. So unlike any other kind of cookie, it lets the website know what kind of access the currently logged in user has. The only special thing about JWT is that they are in JSON format(after decoding).
