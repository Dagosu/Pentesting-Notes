# Kernel Exploits

## Info 

- Kernel exploits can leave the system in an unstable state, which is why you should only run them as a last resort.

## Steps

1. Run the **Linux Exploit Suggester 2** tool to identify potential kernel exploits on the current system:

	```
	perl /home/user/tools/kernel-exploits/linux-exploit-suggester-2/linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl
	```
