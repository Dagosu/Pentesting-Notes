# Unquoted Service Path

1. Use `powershell -c Get-Service` or **WinPeas** to enumerate the services

2. Look for services with spaces in the path

3. Create a payload with the same name and put it in the specific directory 

	E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\IObit\Advanced SystemCare\ASCService.exe`

	Put the payload name **Advanced.exe** in `C:\Program Files (x86)\IObit\`
